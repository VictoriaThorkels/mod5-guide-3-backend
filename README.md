# mod5-guide-3-backend

(Same READEME.md file for the back-end and the front_end. I did not think that it was necessary to make two.)

For Module 5, guide 3 (REST API), I followed the video and did my best to understand. I am also going to do my best answering the "knowledge" and "skills" requirements, but please do let me know if my understanding of how it works is not right. 


Understand the crud operations: 
- CRUD is an acronym of 4 basic operations that can be performed on a database. C stands for Create, R stands for Read, U stands for Update and D stands for Delete.

Understand the flow of data from databases to the user:
- You pick a host for the database, in this case MongoDB. MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. Then you set the database up. The database works as a storage unit, it safely stores importand information as well as performing CRUD opperations.

Understand http requests and how to handle them:
- First I connect my mongodb server wia username and password. Then for example when a user makes a http.get request, it is sent to a specific URL and from there it should be accepted if the code is right.

Understand different types of requests and map them to corresponding database request:
- I am pretty sure that they are talking about the CRUD opperations and how that works from the front-end to the back-end and finally to the database/server. (and ofc back so that the user can make/change/delete/read somthing.

Be able to make a REST API on top of a database:
- Done.

Be able to connect a front-end to a database with the use of a backe-end:
- And Done:)


I hope it looks alright, I had bit of a hard time with this guide (focusing on design), but I did my best to understand it:)
